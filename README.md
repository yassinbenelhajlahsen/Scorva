## 🧩 Challenges Faced

- **Inconsistent Data from Unofficial APIs:**  
  ESPN’s APIs are not publicly documented and return different structures for each league (NBA, NFL, NHL). Normalizing player and game stats into a consistent PostgreSQL schema required extensive reverse-engineering and custom mapping logic.

- **Frontend–Backend Deployment Sync:**  
  Hosting the frontend on **Vercel** and backend on **Railway** caused CORS, routing, and environment variable issues during deployment. I resolved these by explicitly managing allowed origins, rewriting API routes, and validating endpoints across both environments.
